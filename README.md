ðŸš€ Just built a simple but powerful **Banking App in Python**! ðŸ’»

ðŸ§  Project: **BankLite â€“ Console-Based Banking System**
ðŸŽ“ Built as part of #placementprep2025 by @NxtWave

âœ… Features:
- User Registration & Login
- Deposit and Withdraw Money
- Check Account Balance
- Stores data in a file using Python File I/O

Through this mini-project, I explored how Python can be used to create real-world, interactive apps using just core concepts like functions, loops, and file handling. Proud of what Iâ€™ve built! ðŸ™Œ
